						Class Extractor is an OS X application that uses natural language processing to determine what the most important concepts in a class are. All the student needs is an audio recording of the professor lecturing, and Class Extractor will calculate salient course topics. Students can then use this information to organize and prioritize their studying.<br><br>
                        Important concepts are conveyed to the user using two interfaces: Word Cloud and Timeline. Word Cloud is a series of circles whose sizes are directly correlated to the importance of their represented topics. Topic importance comparison is illustrated by size comparison of the circles. Furthermore, topic importance is portrayed by the color of the cloud; more important topics are a deep red, with successively less important concepts becoming a more royal purple.<br><br>
                        Timeline is the second interface. Timeline shows a temporal overview of topic discussion over the course of a single lecture. Armed with this interface, students can see how different topics overlap and interrelate.
