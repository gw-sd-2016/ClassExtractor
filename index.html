						Class Extractor is an OS X application that uses natural language processing to determine what the most important concepts in a class are. All the student needs is an audio recording of the professor lecturing. Students can then use this information to organize and prioritize their studying.<br><br>
                        Important concepts are conveyed to the user using two interfaces: Word Cloud and Timeline. Word Cloud is a series of circles whose sizes are directly correlated to the importance of their represented topics. Topic importance is also portrayed by the color of the cloud; more important topics are a deep red, with successively less important concepts becoming a more royal purple.<br><br>
                        Timeline is the second interface. Timeline shows a temporal overview of topic discussion throughout a single lecture. Armed with this interface, students can see how different topics overlap and interrelate.
